Rover Subsystems Overview
=========================

Drivetrain:

The drivetrain consists of a pair of Parallax continuous-rotation servo
motors with a 20ms duty cycle with a range of 1.3ms - 1.7ms for control
signals.


Platform:

The rover is built on the Parallax Board of Education chassis and
mainboard with an Arduino Mega 2560 (ATmega2560) as the controller. A
pair of LEDs are mounted forward and connected to the controller to
serve as an alert beacon.


Sensors:

Proximity detection is accomplished through an IR strobe and IR receiver.


Communications:

434 MHz RF link
