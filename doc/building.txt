BUILDING THE SOURCE TREE
========================

Overview:

The robot is programmed in Ada, and uses GNAT and GPR for building the
source code. Programming is done via the Arduino bootloader; the ICSP
header is not accessible in the current hardware configuration making
the bootloader a necessity for now.

A Makefile handles the build process, calling GPR as needed, and contains
a target for uploading the code to the board.


Dependencies:

* gprbuild (may be packaged with GNAT, depending on how it has been
  installed)
* avr-binutils
* avr-libc
* AVR-Ada


AVR-Ada:

If there isn't a build for your machine, you'll have to build this from
source. May the gods have mercy on your soul.


Building:

Once the dependencies are installed, "make" will build the tree. All
build artifacts will be placed in the "build" subdirectory. "make upload"
will upload the program to the robot; "make install" is a synonym target
for this. The build should be conducted from the project root.


Uploading:

First, connect a USB programming cable for the Arduino Mega 2560 to the
machine and to the robot. Then issue "make upload" from the project
root.
